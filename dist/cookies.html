						<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">1. SCOPE</span></h2>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400">This Cookie Policy supplements the information contained in our privacy policies and explains how we and our business partners and
								service providers use cookies and related technologies in the course of managing and providing our Services and our communications
								to you. It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400">In some cases, we may use cookies and related technologies described in this Cookie Policy to collect personal information, or to
								collect information that becomes personal information if we combine it with other information. For more details about how we process
								your personal information, please review the applicable privacy policy posted on the Site(s) or Service(s) you use.</span>
						</p>
						<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">2. WHAT ARE COOKIES AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES</span></h2>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400">As is common practice among websites, our Services use cookies, which are tiny files downloaded to your computer that allow us and
								our third-party partners to collect certain information about your interactions with our email communications, Services, and that
								improve your experience. We and our third-party partners and providers may also use other, related technologies to collect this
								information, such as web beacons, pixels, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies and logging technologies
								(collectively, “</span><b>cookies</b><span style="font-weight: 400">”).</span>
						</p>
						<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">3. WHAT WE COLLECT WHEN USING COOKIES</span></h2>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400">We and our third-party partners and providers may use cookies to automatically collect certain types of usage information when you
								visit or interact with our email communications, Sites and Services. For example, we may collect log data about your device and its
								software, such as your IP address, operating system, browser type, date/time of your visit, and other similar information. We may
								collect analytics data or use third-party analytics tools such as Google Analytics to help us measure usage and activity trends for
								our Services and better understand our customer base. We also may collect location data, including general geographic location based
								on IP address or more precise location data, when a user accesses our Services through a mobile device.</span>
						</p>
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We use the following types of cookies:</span></p>
						<ol>
							<li style="font-weight: 400" aria-level="1">
								<b>Strictly necessary cookies.</b><span style="font-weight: 400">
									These cookies enable core functionality such as security, network management and accessibility. You may disable these by changing
									your browser settings, but this may affect how the Sites and Services function. The legal basis for our use of strictly necessary
									cookies is our legitimate interests, namely being able to provide and maintain our Sites and Services.&nbsp;</span>
							</li>
							<li style="font-weight: 400" aria-level="1">
								<b>Functionality cookies</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. These enable a website to remember information that changes the way the website behaves or looks, like your preferred language
									or the region that you are in. The legal basis for our use of functionality cookies is our legitimate interests, namely being able
									to provide and maintain our Sites and Services.&nbsp;</span>
							</li>
							<li style="font-weight: 400" aria-level="1">
								<b>Analytical/performance cookies.</b><span style="font-weight: 400">
									These cookies allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors to our Sites and Services, and to see how visitors move
									around our Sites and Services when they are using them. This helps us to improve the way our Sites and Services work, for example,
									by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.&nbsp;</span>
							</li>
							<li style="font-weight: 400" aria-level="1">
								<b>Targeting cookies.</b><span style="font-weight: 400">
									These cookies record your visit to our Sites and Services, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. They are
									used to track visitors across our Sites. We will use this information to make our Sites and the advertising displayed on it, and
									the marketing messages we send to you more relevant to your interests. We may also share this information with third parties who
									provide a service to us for this purpose. Please see the section “Third Party Data Collection and Online Advertising” below for
									more information.</span>
							</li>
							<li style="font-weight: 400" aria-level="1">
								<b>Third party cookies.</b><span style="font-weight: 400">
									Please be aware that advertisers and other third parties may use their own cookies tags when you click on an advertisement or link
									on our Sites or Services. These third parties are responsible for setting out their own cookie and privacy policies. Please see
									the section “Third Party Data Collection and Online Advertising” below for more information.</span>
							</li>
						</ol>
						<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">4. THIRD PARTY DATA COLLECTION AND ONLINE ADVERTISING</span></h2>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400">We participate in interest-based advertising and use third party advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements based
								on your browsing history. We permit third party online advertising networks, social media companies and other third-party services,
								to collect information about your use of our Services over time so that they may play or display ads on our Services, on other
								websites or services you may use, and on other devices you may use. Typically, though not always, the information used for
								interest-based advertising is collected through tracking technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts,
								location-identifying technologies, and similar technology, which recognize the device you are using and collect information,
								including click stream information, browser type, time and date you visited the site, AdID, precise geolocation and other
								information. We may share a common account identifier (such as a hashed email address or user ID) with our third-party advertising
								partners to help identify you across devices. We and our third-party partners use this information to make the advertisements you
								see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution,
								analytics and market research. We may also use services provided by third parties (such as social media platforms) to serve targeted
								ads to you and others on such platforms. We may do this by providing a hashed version of your email address or other information to
								the platform provider. Please see “Your Choices About Online Ads” below, to learn more about interest-based advertising.</span>
						</p>
						<h3><b>Social Media Widgets and Advertising.</b><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span></h3>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400">Our Services may include social media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button, Pinterest, Instagram, Twitter or other widgets.
								These social media companies may recognize you and collect information about your visit to our Services, and they may set a cookie
								or employ other tracking technologies. Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of those
								companies.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400">We display targeted advertising to you through social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and other
								social media forums. These companies have interest-based advertising programs that allow us to direct advertisements to users who
								have shown interest in our Services while those users are on the social media platform, or to groups of other users who share
								similar traits, such as likely commercial interests and demographics. We may share a unique identifier, such as a user ID or hashed
								email address, with these platform providers, or they may collect information from our website visitors through a first-party pixel,
								in order to direct targeted advertising to you or to a custom audience on the social media platform. These advertisements are
								governed by the privacy policies of those social media companies that provide them. If you do not want to receive targeted ads on
								your social networks, you may be able to adjust your advertising preferences through your settings on those networks.</span>
						</p>
						<h3><b>Third Party Partners.</b></h3>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400">The following is a sample of the third-party service partners we work with to provide advertising services. We will strive to
								update this list if or when we work with new partners which offer you choices about the collection of your information, but as
								partners change and new technologies become available, this list is likely to change over time and may not always reflect our
								current partners.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400">We use Google Analytics to recognize you and link the devices you use when you visit our Services on your browser or mobile device,
								log in to your account on our Services, or otherwise engage with us. We share a unique identifier, like a user ID or hashed email
								address, with Google to facilitate the service. Google Analytics allows us to better understand how our users interact with our
								Services and to tailor our advertisements and content to you. For information on how Google Analytics collects and processes data,
								as well as how you can control information sent to Google, review Google’s site “How Google uses data when you use our partners’
								sites or apps” located at </span><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/"><span style="font-weight: 400">www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. You can learn about Google Analytics’ currently available opt-outs, including the Google Analytics Browser Ad-On at </span><a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/"><span style="font-weight: 400">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400">We may also utilize certain forms of display advertising and other advanced features through Google Analytics, such as Remarketing
								with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration, and Google
								Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. These features enable us to use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics
								cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick advertising cookie) or other third-party cookies together to inform,
								optimize, and display ads based on your past visits to the Services. You may control your advertising preferences or opt-out of
								certain Google advertising products by visiting the Google Ads Preferences Manager, currently available at </span><a href="https://google.com/ads/preferences"><span style="font-weight: 400">https://google.com/ads/preferences</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, or by visiting NAI’s online resources at </span><a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices"><span style="font-weight: 400">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span>

						<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">5. HOW WE USE INFORMATION COLLECTED VIA COOKIES</span></h2>
						<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We use cookies for a variety of reasons, outlined below:</span></p>
						<ul>
							<li style="font-weight: 400" aria-level="1">
								<span style="font-weight: 400">If you create an account with us, then we will use cookies for the management of the signup process and general administration.

							<li style="font-weight: 400" aria-level="1">
								<span style="font-weight: 400">We use cookies when you are logged in so that we can remember this fact. This prevents you from having to log in every single

									restricted features and areas when logged in.</span>
							</li>
							<li style="font-weight: 400" aria-level="1">
								<span style="font-weight: 400">The Services offer newsletter or email subscription services and cookies may be used to remember if you are already registered
									and whether to show certain notifications which might only be valid to subscribed/unsubscribed users.</span>
							</li>
							<li style="font-weight: 400" aria-level="1">
								<span style="font-weight: 400">The Services offer e-commerce or payment facilities, and some cookies are essential to ensure that your order is remembered

							</li>
							<li style="font-weight: 400" aria-level="1">
								<span style="font-weight: 400">When you submit data through a form, such as those found on contact pages or comment forms, cookies may be set to remember your

						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400">If you would prefer not to accept cookies when accessing the Sites, you will be asked your consent to the use of non-Strictly
								Necessary cookies. You are free to deny your consent. Depending on the cookies you allow, the full functionality of the Services may
								be impacted. Additionally, most browsers will allow you to change the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser
								to: (i) notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or
								(iii) set your browser to automatically reject cookies. Be aware that disabling cookies may negatively affect the functionality of
								this and many other websites that you visit. Disabling cookies will usually result in also disabling certain functionalities and

						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400">Depending on your device and operating system, you may not be able to delete or block all cookies. In addition, if you want to
								reject cookies across all your browsers and devices, you will need to do so on each browser on each device you actively use. You may
								also set your email options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know
								whether you have accessed our email and performed certain functions with it.</span>
						</p>
						<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">7. YOUR CHOICES ABOUT ONLINE ADS</span></h2>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400">We support the self-regulatory principles for online behavioral advertising (Principles) published by the Digital Advertising
								Alliance (DAA). This means that we allow you to exercise choice regarding the collection of information about your online activities
								over time and across third-party websites for online interest-based advertising purposes. More information about these Principles
								can be found at </span><a href="https://www.aboutads.info/"><span style="font-weight: 400">www.aboutads.info</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. If you want to opt out of receiving online interest-based advertisements on your internet browser from advertisers and third
								parties that participate in the DAA program and perform advertising-related services for us and our partners, please follow the
								instructions at </span><a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices"><span style="font-weight: 400">www.aboutads.info/choices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, or </span><a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/"><span style="font-weight: 400">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">
								to place an opt-out cookie on your device indicating that you do not want to receive interest-based advertisements. Opt-out cookies
								only work on the internet browser and device they are downloaded onto. If you want to opt out of interest-based advertisements
								across all your browsers and devices, you will need to opt out on each browser on each device you actively use. If you delete
								cookies on your device generally, you will need to opt out again.</span>
						</p>

						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-weight: 400">Please note that when you opt out of receiving interest-based advertisements, this does not mean you will no longer see
								advertisements from us or on our Services. It means that the online ads that you do see from DAA program participants should not be
								based on your interests. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or
								programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs. In addition, third parties may still use cookies to collect
