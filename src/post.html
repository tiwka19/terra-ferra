                The landscape of digital marketing has witnessed a seismic shift in recent years. The cost of influencer marketing has surged by 50%
                over the past three years, and Instagram's paid advertising rates have seen a 65% hike. While these methods can yield results, they
                also significantly inflate marketing budgets. However, there's a silver lining: co-creation. By engaging both your audience and
                influencers in co-creation, brands can not only foster authentic engagement but also optimize marketing expenditures.

              <h2>1. What is Co-creation?</h2>
              <p>
                Co-creation is a collaborative process where brands and consumers come together to create products. Instead of brands dictating the
                market, they engage their audience in the design process.
              </p>
              <h2>2. Why is Co-creation the Future for Outlier Brands?</h2>
              <img src="@img/blog/post.png" alt="post" />
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Authentic Engagement: 73% of consumers prefer brands that personalize shopping experiences. By involving followers in design, brands
                  foster deeper connections.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Unique Designs: Co-creation ensures designs are tailored to audience desires. This is crucial for outlier brands that thrive on
                  distinctiveness.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Increased Loyalty: Studies show that consumers involved in product creation are 60% more likely to purchase and promote the brand.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>3. Steps to Engage Followers in Your Designs:</h2>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Open Platforms for Ideas: Brands like LEGO have used platforms like LEGO Ideas, where fans submit and vote on new set ideas. This
                  approach can be adapted for fashion.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Workshops and Events: Nike, with its NIKEiD platform, allows consumers to design their own sneakers. Hosting events where followers
                  can meet designers can further this engagement.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Feedback Loops: ASOS, a leading fashion brand, regularly seeks feedback on prototypes, ensuring their audience gets what they want.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Acknowledge and Reward: Recognize contributions. For instance, Threadless, a T-shirt company, rewards designers with cash prizes for
                  chosen designs.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>4. Success Stories:</h2>
              <p>
                Adidas, in 2017, sold over 1 million pairs of shoes made from ocean plastic, a concept co-created with their community. Another brand,
                Betabrand, sources design ideas from its community, with some designs getting funded in less than 24 hours due to high demand.
